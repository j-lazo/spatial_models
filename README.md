[Biological pattern formation: from basic mechanisms to complex structures](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.66.1481)
[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis](http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf)
[Stability of Turing patterns in the Brusselator model](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.64.056213)
