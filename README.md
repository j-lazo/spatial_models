# Spatial Models

This repo contains the codes to simulate some spatial models, these are based in the following papers:

1. A. J. Koch and H. Meinhardt [Biological pattern formation: from basic mechanisms to complex structures](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.66.1481)

2. Turing A. [The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis](http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf)

3. B. Peña and C. Pérez-García [Stability of Turing patterns in the Brusselator model](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.64.056213)
